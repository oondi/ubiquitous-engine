                <h1>David Edgar <small>Information Technology Services</small></h1>
				<p>Hi, I’m David! It’s nice to see someone visit my online website! This place is here for potential employers to get a feel for what I do and have obtained within the Information Technology world. It’s simple really, above you will see a few navigation buttons that will take you to various places on this domain. I would love for you to take a few minutes to see what’s been happening in my life recently, or even take a look at some of my credentials/experiences. I like to think of myself as someone who is very keen with keeping up with technology and I try to actively embrace most new technologies. That being said, I would like to thank you dearly for coming to my website. Below you will find an up to date version of my official resume. I hope you have a great day, and good luck in your search for the best fitting candidate.</p>

			<h2>Hobbies</h2>
			<p>I like to think of myself as someone who is athletic and tries to be healthy as much as possible. I'll show you some recent activities I have done outside, and away from the work place so you can better understand not only my hobbies but my personality.</p>
