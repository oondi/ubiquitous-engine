HI! Hope you are having a great day, just wanted to stop you for a moment!
It's great you are checking out my source code and I have to say, it's pretty much the whole point of me making this website.
Now I'm fairly new to bootstrap and I wanted to learn a quick and easy language to see if I could make something
pretty nice to show case my skill sets. I learned and created this website in less than four hours and I'm pretty proud. Now that may seem 
like a lot of time, but I haven't used CSS/HTML in a fairly long time (since I graduated college in 2011)! It was fun, I love to try something new, and
I love to learn. I hope you enjoy the site, and thanks for taking a look at the source code!

Thanks, David

                <h1>David Edgar <small>Information Technology Services</small></h1>
				<p>This website was created by me (David) to showcase and provide my experiences not only in the Information Technology world, but my own personal life outside of work. It’s simple really; above you will see a few navigation buttons that will take you to various places on this domain. I would love for you to take a few minutes to see what’s been happening in my life recently, or even take a look at some of my credentials/experiences. I like to think of myself as someone who is very keen with keeping up with technology and I try to actively embrace most new technologies. That being said, I would like to thank you for coming to my website and taking a look at the abilities I have to offer. Below you will find an up to date version of my official resume. I hope you have a great day, and good luck in your search for the best fitting candidate.</p>
